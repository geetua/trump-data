Trump today demanded an apology from the failing New York Times which accused him (during a major speech before 10,000 people in Myrtle Beach, SC) of mocking a reporter's physical disability when in fact, Mr. Trump does not know anything about the reporter or anything about what the reporter looks like.He was merely mocking the fact that the reporter was trying to pull away from a story that he wrote 14 years ago. Mr. Trump stated, \"Serge Kovaleski must think a lot of himself if he thinks I remember him from decades ago \u2014 if I ever met him at all, which I doubt I did. He should stop using his disability to grandstand and get back to reporting for a paper that is rapidly going down the tubes.\"", "title": "Press Release - Donald J.
