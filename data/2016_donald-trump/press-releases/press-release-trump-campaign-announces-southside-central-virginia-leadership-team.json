Millions of Republican voters stayed home in 2008 and 2012 because they felt the GOP represented the interests of Wall Street rather than those of working Americans. Donald Trump is the best candidate to connect with those voters who feel disaffected from both parties.\"Other members of the leadership team include Republican Party of Virginia State Central Committee Member Renee Trent Maxey, local political activist and businessman Jim McKelvey, and Lynchburg-area attorney Susan Oliver.The Trump Campaign announced Hampton Roads Chairman, Gary C.
