{"date": "2008-03-31", "text": "American Families Could Receive Over $100 Billion In Tax Relief Each Year Hillary Clinton brought her Solutions for the American Economy Tour to Pennsylvania today hosting a roundtable with families in Harrisburg to discuss her plan to cut taxes. Her tax cut proposals would save families thousands of dollars who are struggling to pay for health care, college costs, or the care for an elderly parent or disabled child. It would also help families who are saving for a secure retirement. The cuts would provide middle class families with at least $100 billion in tax relief per year. A typical family making $50,000 would receive a matching tax cut of up to $1,000 to help save and build wealth, a $3,500 tax credit to help pay for college costs, and a generous tax cut to make health care affordable. In addition, a family caring for an elderly parent or disabled child would receive a $3,000 tax credit to help cover the costs of caregiving. Hillary would also expand the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to help larger families, giving at least 3 million families with $1,000 in additional income and would triple the size of the EITC benefit for single workers, providing more than four million people a tax cut averaging $750. \"George Bush's economic ideology is bankrupt - and it's bankrupting America. And John McCain is promising four more years of tax cuts for billionaires and tax breaks for the corporate special interests,\" said Clinton. \"We don't need four more years of Bush economics. We need a Commander in Chief for our economy - someone ready to confront complex economic problems with comprehensive solutions. As president, I'll rein in the corporate special interests and rebuild the middle class. I'll end $55 billion in tax cuts and corporate loopholes and put that money in your pockets with middle class tax cuts.\" The impact of these tax cuts would be enormous for millions of Pennsylvania families. For example, 3.4 million Pennsylvania households would be eligible to receive with new matching tax cuts to help save for retirement, and Hillary's new $3000 Caregivers Tax Credit would benefit at least 200,000 Pennsylvania seniors, people with disabilities and their families. Hillary discussed the financial challenges of paying for health care, college costs, and saving for retirement with seven families from the Harrisburg area at the Capitol Diner. Joe and Jody Rebarchek were two of the participants in the discussion. They have three children, one of whom is heading to college. After being a stay-at-home mom for ten years, Jody recently re-entered the workforce to supplement the family's income. In addition, Kathleen Panza, a small business owner who is struggling to pay for the health care costs for herself and her employees, discussed some of her challenges with Hillary today. Senator Clinton was also joined by Annette Anderson, of Harrisburg; Phyllis Campbell, of Mechanicsburg; Marisol Craig and Angelo Craig, of Mechanicsburg; Wayne Scott and his daughter Kaylie Lauren, of Harrisburg; and Ana Vargas and her daughter Alissa Ramos, also of Harrisburg, PA. The stories of people at today's event mirror what is happening to families all across America. As the economy slides into recession, hardworking American families face growing financial stress. Americans are working harder than ever but wages are stagnant and household income is down nearly $1000 since 2000. Record housing price declines have already eroded $2 trillion in household wealth and have rocked the basic economic security of millions of American families. And at the same time, gas is now over $3.50 in many areas of Pennsylvania, healthcare premiums have nearly doubled since 2000 and college costs are up 66%. With the mortgage crisis freezing up many sources of student loans, families in Pennsylvania are facing unprecedented financial difficulties in helping their children pay for college. Rather than easing the burden on middle class families, George Bush's tax policies have exacerbated the problem. President Bush's answer to every economic challenge has been to lavish new tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans - to the tune of $500 billion already - while offering too little for the broad middle class. For example, the typical working family received about $500 from the Bush tax cut but is paying about $2000 more each year in energy costs alone than they were in 2000. What the Bush tax cuts did do, however, was reward the passive wealth of the wealthiest Americans and shift the tax burden onto the wages of typical workers by lowering taxes on capital gains, dividends and the Estate Tax even for the wealthiest Americans. They have created a tax code that allows a billionaire like Warren Buffett to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. And they have driven up our deficit, forcing us to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars from countries like China and putting our economic security at risk. Hillary Clinton believes it offends our values as a nation to have a tax code that allows Wall Street millionaires to pay lower taxes than teachers, nurses and truck drivers. And it undermines our economy's potential when America's middle class is being squeezed without any help. Her plan will close loopholes that benefit the wealthy and provide broad and direct tax relief to tens of millions of hardworking families in Pennsylvania and across the country.
