{"date": "2016-01-29", "text": "Hillary for America National Press Secretary Brian Fallon released the following statement\u0412\u00a0Friday\u0412\u00a0after the intelligence community demanded that more than 20 emails from Hillary Clinton's tenure at the State Department be fully withheld from public release:\"We firmly oppose the complete blocking of the release of these emails. Since first providing her emails to the State Department more than one year ago, Hillary Clinton has urged that they be made available to the public.\u0412\u00a0We feel no differently today.\"After a process that has been dominated by bureaucratic infighting that has too often played out in public view, the loudest and leakiest participants in this interagency dispute have now prevailed in blocking any release of these emails. This flies in the face of the fact that these emails were unmarked at the time they were sent, and have been called 'innocuous' by certain intelligence officials. We understand that these emails were likely originated on the State Department's unclassified system before they were ever shared with Secretary Clinton, and they have remained on the department's unclassified system for years. And, in\u0412\u00a0at least\u0412\u00a0one case, the emails appear to involve information from a published news article.\u0412\u00a0\"This appears to be over-classification run amok. We will pursue all appropriate avenues to see that her emails are released in a manner consistent with her call last year.\"", "title": "Hillary for America Statement Calling for Release of Secretary Clinton's Emails"}
