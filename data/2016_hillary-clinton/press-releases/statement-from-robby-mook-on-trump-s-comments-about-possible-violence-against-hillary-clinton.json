Whether this is done to provoke\u0412\u00a0protesters at a rally or casually or even as a joke, it is an\u0412\u00a0unacceptable quality in anyone seeking the job of Commander in Chief.\u0412\u00a0This kind of talk should be out of bounds for a presidential\u0412\u00a0candidate, just like it should be out of bounds for a presidential\u0412\u00a0candidate to peddle a conspiracy theory about the President of the\u0412\u00a0United States for five years. But we've seen again and again that no\u0412\u00a0amount of failed resets can change who Donald Trump is. He is unfit\u0412\u00a0to be President and it is time Republican leaders stand up to denounce\u0412\u00a0this disturbing behavior in their nominee.\"", "title": "Statement from Robby Mook On Trump's Comments About Possible Violence Against Hillary Clinton"}
