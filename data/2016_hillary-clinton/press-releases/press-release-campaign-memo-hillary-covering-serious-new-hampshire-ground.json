From grassroots house parties to detailed policy announcements, Hillary Clinton is continuing to impress at every stone fence she passes, back porch she stands on and New Hampshire voter she meets. In the month of August, Hillary Clinton made her 12th and 13th trips to the Granite State. She traveled to Derry, Portsmouth, Rochester, Lebanon, Warner, Concord and Manchester.  During those visits, she delivered three policy speeches on important issues that matter to New Hampshire voters including how she will preserve the American dream of homeownership; rebuild America's infrastructure and improve healthcare quality in America. In addition to unveiling plans to help make real change happen when she is President, Hillary continued her conversation with New Hampshire voters by attending smaller house parties in Concord and Manchester. She also made a stop at the MainStreet Bookends in Warner and purchased \"The Careful Use of Compliments\" by Alexander McCall Smith. The word got out that Hillary was dropping by and nearly 300 people came out to see her. Hillary also toured the  Portsmouth Naval Shipyard  to speak with military leaders and union representatives about Shipyard operations. Don't Take Our Word for It:  On Hillary's plan to address healthcare quality... \"I was extremely impressed with what she had to say. I felt like she was being very honest. And I got the impression that what she was saying, she really meant it.\"", "title": "Press Release - Campaign Memo: Hillary Covering Serious New Hampshire Ground"}
