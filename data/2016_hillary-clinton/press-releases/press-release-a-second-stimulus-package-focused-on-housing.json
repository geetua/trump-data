{"date": "2008-03-20", "text": "Hillary Clinton's Plan to Help Struggling American Families, Not Just Wall Street Banks Just over a month ago, Congress passed and President Bush signed a $168 billion stimulus package to help our economy avert a housing-led recession. Yet while the legislation contained important tax rebates for working families and seniors, it did virtually nothing to address our housing crisis. It was clear then, as it is now, that the housing and credit crisis is the biggest threat to the health of our economy. Declining home values and record foreclosures threaten to not only devastate millions of American families but send communities across the country spiraling into deep recession. Senator Clinton believes that if we can extend a $30 billion lifeline to avoid a crisis for Wall Street banks, we should extend at least $30 billion in immediate assistance to at-risk communities and families facing foreclosure. That is why Senator Clinton is calling on Congress and the President to pass a second stimulus package. This time around, the primary focus should be on addressing the growing housing crisis. And by investing new, temporary resources in a housing-focused stimulus package, we can avoid the worst fall-out from the current downturn, keep families in their homes and stabilize communities. The new stimulus package should include:  A $30 Billion Emergency Housing Fund. The fund will provide states and localities with broad tools to stem the impact of concentrated foreclosures, including purchasing foreclosed properties, providing mortgage restructuring and counseling, and undertaking anti-blight programs.  Expanding the Mortgage Revenue Bond Program, This reform will give state housing agencies up to $10 billion in additional resources to refinance unworkable mortgages.
