As a proud Filipino American, I am deeply concerned that families like mine who immigrated from the Philippines would have been the target of Trump's reckless and baseless policy proposals. They, and many other immigrants, have made valuable contributions to society, and make our nation stronger.\"Hillary Clinton\u0412\u00a0has a plan\u0412\u00a0to fight for comprehensive immigration reform and to reunite families, knowing that Filipinos have some of the longest visa wait times: up to 23 years in many cases. Hillary knows that America is a country of immigrants, and understands that we are a stronger country when we come together.\"", "title": "Hillary for America Statement on Trump Renewing His Call to Ban Muslims and Further Restrict Immigration from Countries Like The Philippines"}
