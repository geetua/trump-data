{"date": "2007-12-23", "text": "The Clinton Campaign today announced the endorsement of former Secretary of Defense William J. Perry and named him a Senior National Security Adviser. \"The United States today faces an array of challenges and opportunities unparalleled in recent history. America needs a leader with the combination of experience, judgment, competence and credibility to begin working on Day One to restore our standing in the world. Hillary Clinton is that leader,\" Secretary Perry said. \"Hillary has that strength and experience to responsibly bring the disastrous war in Iraq to an end and reclaim America's leadership position in the world. From her years as First Lady to her work on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Hillary understands what our military needs to succeed in the 21st century. She knows the price of sending our courageous men and women in uniform into harm's way. She has stood up for veterans suffering from Gulf War syndrome, has led the fight in the Senate for expanded benefits for our active duty service members and veterans, and has demanded better body armor for our troops in Iraq. Hillary Clinton is ready to be commander in chief.\" ", "title": "Former Defense Secretary William J. Perry Endorses Clinton"}
