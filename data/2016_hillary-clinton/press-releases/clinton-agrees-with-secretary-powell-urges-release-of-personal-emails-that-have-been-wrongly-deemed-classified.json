{"date": "2016-02-04", "text": "According to a new report\u0412\u00a0Thursday, the State Department Inspector General has determined that work-related emails sent on personal accounts belonging to former Secretary of State Colin Powell and to senior aides to former Secretary Condoleezza Rice contain classified national security information. This conclusion \u0412\u2013 which was reached despite the lack of any classification\u0412\u00a0markings within the emails \u0412\u2013 has been strenuously opposed by Secretary Powell, who has called for these emails to be released.In response to this announcement, Hillary for America Chairman John Podesta released the following statement:\"This announcement about Secretary Powell's emails shows just how routine it is for government bureaucrats\u0412\u00a0to go overboard when it comes to judging whether information is too sensitive for the public to see. Hillary Clinton agrees\u0412\u00a0with her predecessor that his emails, like hers, are being inappropriately subjected to\u0412\u00a0over-classification. She joins his call for these emails to be released so that the public can view the contents for itself.\"", "title": "Clinton Agrees with Secretary Powell, Urges Release of Personal Emails That Have Been Wrongly Deemed 'Classified'"}
