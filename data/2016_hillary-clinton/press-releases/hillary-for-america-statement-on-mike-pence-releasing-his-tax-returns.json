But it's Donald Trump - who just this week attacked America's generals and showered praise on Russia's authoritarian leader - running to be our next president. Trump has continued to hide behind fake excuses to avoid coming clean with the American people, thumbing his nose at a basic level of transparency practiced by every major party nominee since 1976. As prominent Republicans have speculated, Trump's returns could reveal further ties to Russia and its oligarchs, the truth about his personal wealth, or more lies about his charitable contributions. But we won't know until we see them. According to a recent poll, more than than six in 10 Republicans are now asking: what is Trump hiding?\"Last month, Tim Kaine released 10 years of tax returns. On the same day, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 personal tax return, building on the Clintons' tradition of making their returns public since 1977. You can view both Clinton and Kaine's returns here.Considering Trump has released his taxes under audit before, and his actions help determine the speed at which the IRS can complete the audit, why won't Trump release his tax returns and what is he hiding? Here's a few theories:</span>1. Trump may not be worth the $10 billion that he claims2. Trump may pay little to no income tax3. Trump is deeply in debt and owes more than a hundred million to a foreign bank4. Trump wrongly undervalues his properties to local tax men5. Trump is making a \"flood of cash\" from running for president6. Trump is taking tax breaks he shouldn't7. Trump is hiding his lack of charitable donationsHere's 5 FACTS we know about Trump's tax returns:1. In multiple years in which we know Trump's tax rate, he paid a rate of 0%2. Trump promised millions in charity, but reportedly gave less than $10,000 over a period of 7 years3. Trump has accepted a grant intended for small businesses affected by 9/114. Trump has repeated accepted a tax break intended for middle-class people5. Trump might not even be undergoing an audit in the first place - and he refuses to present a letter from the IRS, sent to every individual who is audited, to prove itProminent Republicans question what Trump is hiding in his tax returns:George Will: \"Perhaps one more reason why we're not seeing his tax returns is because he is deeply involved in dealing with Russian oligarchs.\"Mitt Romney: \"Either he's not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is\" or \"There's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes.\"Mark Sanford: \"I Support You, Donald Trump. Now Release Your Tax Returns.\"Is there ANY way to make Trump release his\u0412\u00a0tax\u0412\u00a0returns?
