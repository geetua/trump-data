{"date": "2007-07-26", "text": "Senator Clinton taped an interview with CNN's John King this afternoon where she was asked to react to Barack Obama referring to her as \"Bush-Cheney Lite.\" The following is what Senator Clinton said (the interview will air later this afternoon on CNN): Sen. Clinton: \"Well, this is getting kind of silly. I've been called a lot of things in my life but I've never been called George Bush or Dick Cheney certainly. We have to ask what's ever happened to the politics of hope? \"I have been saying consistently for a number of years now, we have to end the Bush era of ignoring problems, ignoring enemies and adversaries. And I have been absolutely clear that we've got to return to robust and effective diplomacy. But I don't want to see the power and prestige of the United States President put at risk by rushing into meetings with the likes of Chavez, and Castro, and Ahmadinejad.\"", "title": "Press Release - Clinton/CNN Interview to Air this Afternoon"}
