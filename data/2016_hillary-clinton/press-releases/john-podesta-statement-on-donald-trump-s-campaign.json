{"date": "2016-09-10", "text": "Today, Hillary for America Chair John Podesta released the following statement:\"It's no surprise that Donald Trump is defending his most offensive views and extremist allies. This is the man who has spent 15 months insulting nearly every group in America \u0412\u2013 African Americans, Muslims, Latinos, Native Americans, immigrants, women, veterans, people with disabilities, and the list goes on. \u0412\u00a0This is the man who hired Steve Bannon, a promoter of the racist \"alt-right\" movement, to be his campaign CEO, and has inspired white supremacists and conspiracy theorists like David Duke and Alex Jones. \u0412\u00a0So it's no wonder Trump is standing up for them yet again. \u0412\u00a0This is without a doubt deplorable \u0412\u2013 but this is who he is. \u0412\u00a0This is what his campaign has always been about. \u0412\u00a0And this is a fight we're eager to have. As Hillary said today, we won't back down. We will never stop calling out Trump's bigotry and racist rhetoric, because we know our country is better than this. \u0412\u00a0America is better than Donald Trump.\"", "title": "John Podesta Statement on Donald Trump's Campaign"}
