{"date": "2008-04-01", "text": "Sen. Obama voted for the 2005 Energy Bill, written in secret by Vice President Cheney and the energy lobby. Thomas Friedman referred to the bill as \"the sum of all lobbies.\" U.S. PIRG noted that the bill's \"heavy tilt toward big oil companies reflects the influence of Exxon Mobil and other oil companies on policy-makers in Washington, DC.\" The Washington Post editorialized that the bill was a \"pi\u0413\u0453\u0412\u00b1ata of perks for energy industries.\" Indeed, the bill contained $6 billion in subsidies to the oil and gas industry and $12 billion to the nuclear power industry. Although Sen. Obama voted for the legislation, he has spoken as if he opposed it on the campaign trail, criticizing it repeatedly. At a presidential debate he said \"You can look at how Dick Cheney did his energy policy...he met with oil and gas companies forty times, and that's how they put together our energy policy.\" He's attributed the failure of our current energy policy to Congress's \"failure to stand up to the lobbyists.\" Sen. Obama's rhetoric blasting the policies of Vice President Dick Cheney and energy lobbyists can be stirring. But Obama's actions haven't matched his words.

And the reason it doesn't change \u2013 you can take a look at how Dick Cheney did his energy policy. He met with environmental groups one, he met with renewable energy folks once, and then he met with oil and gas companies forty times, and that's how they put together our energy policy.

Barack Obama (D-Ill.) said: \"I'm in Washington. I see what's going on. I see those powers and principalities have snuck back in there, that they're writing the energy bills and the drug laws.\" It was a fine populist riff calculated to appeal to Democratic audiences as Obama seeks his party's presidential nomination. But not only did Obama vote for the Senate's big energy bill in 2005, he also put out a press release bragging about its provisions, and his Senate Web site carries a news article about the vote headlined, \"Senate energy bill contains goodies for Illinois.\" [The Politico, 3/26/07] Obama: Energy policy is the result of Congress's 'failure to stand up to the lobbyists': \"For many years now, the lobbyists and the special interests have been blocking progress on the issues that matter most to folks who live in rural areas,\" Obama said. \"Because of our failure to stand up to the lobbyists and develop a real energy policy, Exxon has been making record oil profits at a time when Elko has been paying record gas prices.
