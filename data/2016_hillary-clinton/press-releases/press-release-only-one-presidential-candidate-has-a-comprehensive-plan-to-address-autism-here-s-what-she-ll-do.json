{"date": "2016-01-06", "text": "Everyone running for president should be talking about this. Hillary Clinton has always fought to fix the problems that keep families up at night\u2014and for millions of families, autism is a major issue in their lives.An estimated 3.5 million Americans\u2014including one in 68 children\u2014have autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Many go undiagnosed for years, and services that would vastly improve their lives are unaffordable for most families. That's why Hillary just announced a broad plan to help people of all ages and their families who are impacted by autism.  Here's what it will do:1. Launch a national early screening campaignDiagnosis is the first step in helping people with autism. Yet, studies show that in many children, especially girls and African American and Latino children, early signs of autism go overlooked for months or even years. Hillary's plan will boost early screening rates so that kids can get diagnosed and receive the services that will make a difference in their lives.2.?Ensure health insurance coverage for autism servicesWhen autism services aren't covered by insurance, many families can't afford them. The Affordable Care Act has gone a long way to help those with autism get the support they need\u2014by making it illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, ending lifetime dollar limits on benefits, and allowing young adults to remain on their parents' coverage until the age of 26. 3. Invest in research to deepen our understanding of autismWe need to invest in more research to better understand autism, create better diagnostic tools, and improve treatments and services for people on the autism spectrum. Hillary will significantly increase funding for autism-related research and call for the first-ever study of the prevalence of adult autism.4. Increase employment opportunities for those with autismPeople with autism are unemployed at a much higher rate: More than half of youth with autism are not getting a job or pursuing higher education in the two years after they graduate high school. Hillary's plan will work to close the employment gap by launching a new Autism Works Initiative that will include a post-graduation transition plan for every student with autism, along with a public-private partnership to connect people with autism to employment opportunities.Hillary is the only candidate with a?comprehensive plan?to support Americans with autism. And her proposals are drawing praise from advocates and families alike.Thank you @HillaryClinton for your new autism initiative for our little heroes!\n#autism\nhttps://t.co/iz7iJJZc5r pic.twitter.com/pwDjkfruLD\u2014 Jenn Medvin (@AlDenteGuida) January 5, 2016 My vote is undecided.
