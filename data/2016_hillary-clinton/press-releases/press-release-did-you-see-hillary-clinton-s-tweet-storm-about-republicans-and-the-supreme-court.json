When a vacancy opens up on the Supreme Court, the president has a responsibility to nominate a new justice\u2014and the Senate has a responsibility to vote. But hours after Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republicans in the Senate and on the campaign trail pledged to block any replacement justice President Obama nominates. With so many issues in front of the court right now, their actions would have a direct and immediate impact on millions of lives. Hillary Clinton knows the American people can't wait, and she's taking Republicans to task. 1 Until Jan. 20, 2017, it's @POTUS' job to nominate Supreme Court justices\u2014it's right there in the Constitution. -H pic.twitter.com/AWV47TRaTw\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 2 The need to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is not an occasion for politics as usual. This has real and urgent stakes for Americans now. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 3 Right now, millions of families are waiting for SCOTUS to decide on @POTUS' executive actions on immigration. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 20164 Right now, the fundamental principle of \"one person, one vote\" is at stake in a case before the Supreme Court. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 5 And right now, a case from Texas could determine whether the right to abortion will be a reality for all or some. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 6 These decisions could determine whether we as a nation uphold our principles of liberty and equality, or turn back the clock. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 7 With these critical cases in the balance, Republicans wasted no time in vowing to block any SCOTUS nomination from @POTUS. A new low. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 8 I have news for Republicans who would put politics over the Constitution: Refusing to do your duty isn't righteous, it's disgraceful. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 9 There are 339 days until the next president takes office. The Senate has never taken more than 125 days to vote on a SCOTUS nominee. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 10 As for complaints that this is an election year: 1988 was an election year, too\u2014and Justice Kennedy was confirmed 97-0. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 16, 2016 11 So, a message for Senate Republicans: Fill this vacancy. @POTUS will do his job.
