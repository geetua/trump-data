{"date": "2007-09-21", "text": "In a report released today, Hillary Clinton addressed how her American Health Choices Plan will impact seniors. Under her plan, seniors will be able to keep Medicare but she will make their health care more affordable by lowering the cost of prescription drugs, reducing medical errors, and implementing preventive measures, such as screenings, that can head off illness early on. Clinton's plan will also promote innovative care management programs to help those with chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease and cancer -- illnesses that affect many seniors. \"We need to honor our commitment to our seniors and ensure that they are receiving the best care possible,\" said Clinton. \"While Medicare has worked wonderfully for many seniors, we can do even better by cutting their drug costs, giving our seniors the tools and resources to prevent disease, and providing better management of their chronic conditions if they do become ill.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than a quarter of all seniors reported spending at least $100 per month on their medication. Hillary Clinton's plan will tackle drug costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, creating a pathway for biogeneric drug competition, removing barriers to generic competition, and providing more oversight over pharmaceutical companies' financial relationships with providers. Clinton's plan will also address the challenges many seniors face in managing chronic conditions. In 2002, the top three causes of death for Americans over the age of 65 were heart disease, cancer and stroke. Currently, at least 80 percent of older Americans have at least one chronic condition and 50 percent have at least two. The American Health Choices Plan will ensure higher quality and better coordination of care by using state-of-the-art chronic care coordination models within federally-funded programs to provide care for Americans afflicted with these costly, multi-faceted illnesses. In addition, the American Health Choices Plan will help seniors receive preventive services so they can be diagnosed and treated for diseases in early stages rather than when that disease becomes serious or life-threatening. For example, up to 30 percent of deaths from breast cancer could be prevented through regular screening mammograms, but about 20 percent of women ages 65 to 69 have never had one. The plan will require coverage of preventive services that experts deem proven and effective, such blood pressure, blood glucose, cholesterol, vision and hearing screenings.
