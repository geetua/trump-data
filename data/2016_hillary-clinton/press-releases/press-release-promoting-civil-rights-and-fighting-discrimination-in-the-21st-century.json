{"date": "2007-09-15", "text": "Today in Charleston, SC, Hillary Clinton will announce her agenda to fight discrimination as President and to restore the federal government's historic role as a champion of civil rights. She will focus on renewing and strengthening the Department of Justice's civil rights mission. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the creation of the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice. It also marks the seventh year of a concerted effort by the Bush Administration to turn the Civil Rights Division away from its historical mission and its traditions of professionalism, and toward an agenda driven by partisanship, cronyism, and ideology. As President, Hillary Clinton will take five specific steps to undo the damage done under President Bush and Attorney Generals Gonzales and Ashcroft, to advance civil rights, and to end discrimination. 1. Save the Civil Rights Division from eight years of the Bush Administration. Hillary will:   Direct the Attorney General to submit \u2013 within 90 days of taking office \u2013 a report that recommends how to rebuild DOJ's traditional role in defending civil rights and the rule of law, and that reviews charges of improper, politically motivated hiring to determine whether laws were broken.   Restore professionalism and remove politics from hiring, case deliberations, and policy decisions across the Department of Justice.  Increase funding for the Civil Rights Division by $30 million.
