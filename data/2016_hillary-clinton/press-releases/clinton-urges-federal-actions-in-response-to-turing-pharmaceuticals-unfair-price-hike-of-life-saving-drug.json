{"date": "2015-10-15", "text": "Today, Hillary Clinton sent letters to the heads of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urging the agencies to review actions they could take to protect consumers against the unfair prescription drug price hike executed by Turing Pharmaceuticals.\u0412\u00a0Last month, Turing CEO Martin Shkreli raised the price of a life-saving HIV drug, Daraprim, by more than 5,000 percent overnight, prompting Clinton to decry his actions. The public outcry about Shkreli's decision forced the CEO to say he would lower the drug's price; however, the price of Daraprim has not yet been meaningfully reduced. Clinton is now urging the FDA to expedite processes for approving a generic competitor for Daraprim or for allowing temporary importation of similar drugs. In addition, she is encouraging the FTC to investigate whether Turing's practice of restricting the distribution of Daraprim amounts to anticompetitive behavior under federal law. Further, she is asking the FTC to study and provide recommendations to Congress and the Administration on how best to address price gouging when it is the result of unilateral action in a market with no competition. \u0412\u00a010/19/15 FDA Letter on Turing by The Briefing10/19/15 FTC Letter on Turing by The Briefing", "title": "Clinton Urges Federal Actions in Response to Turing Pharmaceuticals' Unfair Price Hike of Life-Saving Drug"}
