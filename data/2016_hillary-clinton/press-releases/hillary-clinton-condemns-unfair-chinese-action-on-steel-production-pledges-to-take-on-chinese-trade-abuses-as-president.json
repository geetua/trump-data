{"date": "2016-04-11", "text": "After Chinese government officials\u0412\u00a0announced\u0412\u00a0yesterday that China will continue to support overcapacity in their steel production, Hillary Clinton released the following statement condemning the unfair decision as threatening to American manufacturing and jobs and pledging to take on Chinese trade abuses as President:\"Just last week, I went to the AFL-CIO convention in Pennsylvania and said that I would not tolerate attempts by China to solve its growing economic problems on the back of American workers. A few days later, they announced plans to keep propping up significant overcapacity in their steel production \u0412\u2013 meaning that they'll keep unloading artificially cheap steel into global markets at the expense of countries and workers that play by the rules. As President, I'll aggressively pursue trade cases and impose consequences when China breaks the rules by dumping its cheap products in our markets. And I'll oppose efforts to grant China so-called \"market economy\" status, which would weaken our tools for dealing with this behavior. I've gone toe-to-toe with China's top leaders on some of the toughest issues we face. I know how they operate \u0412\u2013 and they know that if I'm President, the games are going to end.\"BackgroundClinton has a long record of standing up to abusive Chinese trade practices. As Senator, she fought for workers and manufacturers in New York, standing up to China when they tried to put tariffs on New York's exports. In communities across the state, from Buffalo to Rochester to Albany, Clinton brought together workers, businesses large and small, and every level of government to work to invest in good-paying jobs and production in the state. As Secretary of State, she confronted Chinese leaders on a wide swath of issues, from cyber attacks to human rights to climate change.Clinton\u0412\u00a0understands\u0412\u00a0that America spent generations working with partners to develop strong and fair rules of the road for the global economy \u0412\u2013 but those rules only work if the U.S. enforces them.\u0412\u00a0Tough enforcement and other smart policies to support a manufacturing renaissance are the only way we can ensure that trade helps American workers. That's why, throughout this campaign, Clinton has made clear that, as President, she\u0412\u00a0will: Crack down on foreign countries, like China, when they cheat the rules:\u0412\u00a0If foreign countries dump\u0412\u00a0products on our markets, like China is doing right now with steel, Clinton's administration\u0412\u00a0will take countervailing action. She will appoint a new trade prosecutor that reports directly to the President and triple the number of trade enforcement officers to keep other\u0412\u00a0countries honest. She will take on foreign countries that keep their goods artificially cheap\u0412\u00a0by manipulating their currencies, and expand our toolbox to include effective new remedies\u0412\u00a0to respond, such as duties, tariffs, or other measures. And she opposes China's efforts\u0412\u00a0to be recognized as a \"market economy,\" which would defang our anti-dumping laws. Say \"no\" to new trade agreements that don't meet her high bar \u0412\u2013 including the Trans-Pacific\u0412\u00a0Partnership.Clinton will hit pause and say \"no\" to new trade agreements unless they create\u0412\u00a0American jobs, raise wages, and improve our national security. After looking at the final\u0412\u00a0terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, including what it contains on currency\u0412\u00a0manipulation and its weak rules of origin standard for what counts as a car that can get\u0412\u00a0treaty benefits, she opposed the agreement because it did not meet her test. And she will\u0412\u00a0hold every future trade agreement to the same high standard. Review the trade agreements we already have on the books.Clinton has said for almost a\u0412\u00a0decade that we need to renegotiate NAFTA, and she still believes that today. She\u0412\u00a0would review all of our trade agreements with the same scrutiny. Fight for American exports.U.S. exports total more than $2 trillion dollars and exporters\u0412\u00a0pay workers higher wages. Clinton will support the efforts of businesses large and small\u0412\u00a0to tap new markets \u0412\u2013 both at home and internationally \u0412\u2013 to support good paying jobs and\u0412\u00a0spur economic growth. That is why she stands for American workers in the face of\u0412\u00a0misguided opposition by supporting the Export-Import Bank, and other policies that drive\u0412\u00a0American exports.", "title": "Hillary Clinton Condemns Unfair Chinese Action on Steel Production, Pledges to Take On Chinese Trade Abuses as President"}
