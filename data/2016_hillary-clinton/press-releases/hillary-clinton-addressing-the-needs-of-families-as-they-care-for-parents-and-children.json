With less than 20 days until the primary, the announcement is yet another sign of the momentum the Clinton campaign continues to build across the state. \"Hillary Clinton is the leader that America so desperately needs right now. She has promised to stop the war in Iraq, and I feel that she will be effective in finding solutions to the problems that face our great country, not the least of which is health care,\" said Patricia Cummings of Concord. \"Hillary is the kind of person who will stand up for what she believes. These are just a few reasons I have chosen Hillary as my candidate for president of the United States.\" As President, Senator Clinton will work to address the needs of families as they care for parents and children. \"I was proud to be a \u0412\u2018working mom' and I'm now a proud \u0412\u2018working daughter.' I'm grateful that my family could make the choices that were right for us. And that's what I want for all families: that same opportunity to make the choices that work for them.\" Media interested in obtaining a complete list of all the Women for Hillary should contact the New Hampshire for Hillary press office at nhpress@hillaryclinton.com, or at (603) 782-4647.
