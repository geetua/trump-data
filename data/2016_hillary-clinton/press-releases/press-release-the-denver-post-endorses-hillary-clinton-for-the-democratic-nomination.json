{"date": "2008-02-01", "text": "Denver, CO - The Denver Post's editorial board endorsed Hillary Clinton for the democratic nomination today. The endorsement is extremely rare for the Denver Post, which typically refrains from endorsing in presidential primaries. Excerpts from the endorsement \"Clinton's plan for universal health insurance is far more comprehensive than the hit-and-miss proposal put forward by Obama.\"  ...\"as important as that symbolism is, Democrats have an even greater responsibility: to pick the most qualified candidate to lead America at a time when it faces great challenges at home and abroad. Measured by her long record in public life and her thoughtful proposals to deal with America's most pressing problems, The Post believes that candidate is New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.\" \"Clinton's long record in public life shows her well prepared to deal with two of America's greatest challenges: ending the war in Iraq and solving our health insurance crisis. \"Clinton is well prepared to oversee a careful disengagement from Iraq and to serve as the military and diplomatic leader of the free world. She served with distinction on the Senate Armed Services Committee, where she mastered the intricate details of national and international security. Obama has no comparable experience on military or diplomatic issues.\"  The full text of the endorsement is below", "title": "Press Release - The Denver Post Endorses Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Nomination"}
