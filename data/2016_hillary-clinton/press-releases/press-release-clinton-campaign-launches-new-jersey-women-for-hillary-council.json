{"date": "2007-10-19", "text": "The Clinton campaign announced today the formation of the New Jersey Women for Hillary Council, inviting Hillary supporters in New Jersey to join the growing grassroots network. The Council is made up of women from across the state who will be active leaders in New Jersey, speaking to their friends, family and associates about this election, and helping to expand the network of women across America supporting Hillary Clinton's campaign. This announcement is part of the campaign's week-long focus on \"Women Changing America.\" During the week, the campaign is highlighting the decisive role women can play in this election, discussing issues important to women and celebrating the ways that women are changing America everyday. \"In 35 years as an advocate for women, children and families, I know that women can make a powerful difference,\" Hillary said. \"Women are changing America and I am so proud to welcome the New Jersey Women for Hillary Council to our campaign. Working together, we will address the issues of concern to women and families, and how we can make the changes America needs.\" \"It gives me great pride to kick-off this effort in New Jersey. We invite women from across the state to join this council and become ambassadors for Hillary by reaching out to their networks on Hillary's behalf while also educating and empowering others to make history by making Hillary our 44th President,\" said NJ Assembly Majority Leader Bonnie Watson Coleman. \"We are all excited about Hillary Clinton's Presidential candidacy and the Women's Council will be an effective way for women across the state to get involved and make an impact on the 2008 election,\" said Senator Nia Gill. \"There is so much excitement for Hillary right now. Women want to get involved and we are making it easy for them to sign up at www.hillaryclinton.com/njwomen.\" Hillary kicked off the week with an appearance on The View and spoke at the Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Committee's Annual Fall Campaign Luncheon in New York. On Tuesday, she traveled to New Hampshire to announce a new policy proposal to help parents balance work and family life. On Wednesday, nearly 1,000 women contributors from 47 states around the country will convene for a women's summit in support of the Clinton campaign - a full-day event that will raise well over $1 million. And on Thursday, Hillary will discuss the importance of health care for women when she participates in the Presidential Candidate Forums organized by the Federation of American Hospitals and Families USA and hosts a conference call with health care professionals from the American Medical Women's Association. The week's events underscore why Hillary enjoys such deep support among women voters by emphasizing how her strength and experience make her the candidate best able to deliver change on the issues most important to them.
