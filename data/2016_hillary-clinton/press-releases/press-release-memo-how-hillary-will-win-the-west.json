Hillary Country. Hillary has generated excitement in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, Washington, California and across the West, where she's given thousands of supporters the chance to see her up close.

Nowhere is Hillary's Western strength more evident than in Nevada, where a recent poll shows her breaking 50% in the primary and leading by 37 points. And her support among local leaders only continues to grow, including: Clark County Commissioner Rory Reid, former Governor Bob Miller, Senate Minority Leader Dina Titus, former Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones, State Treasurer Kate Marshall, Assembly Majority Leader John Oceguera, Dr. Robert Fowler, Clark County Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani, former Attorney General Frankie Sue Del Papa, Las Vegas Latin Chamber of Commerce Chairman Robert Gomez and Reno-Sparks Indian Colony Chairman Arlan Menendez.. This summer, Hillary has drawn huge crowds across the Silver State, including 3,500 in Reno, more than 3,000 in Las Vegas and even 2,500 in rural Pahrump\u2014where she's opened a regional field office. The Clinton campaign has brought the Hillary tour to most of the Western states, and has a strong on-the-ground presence with offices, field organizers, and thousands of volunteers spanning the region.
