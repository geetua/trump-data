{"date": "2008-03-12", "text": "Una Vida Mejor Para Todos Expanding opportunity is at the core of the American dream. Hillary believes that anyone who works hard and plays by the rules can succeed and create better lives for themselves and their children. Latinos understand and value the importance of opportunity - a good education system and good jobs. That is why Hillary Clinton has an agenda that expands opportunity for Latinos, and ensures una vida mejor para todos. SMALL BUSINESSES Hillary Clinton's economic agenda is focused on creating good jobs for all Americans. That starts by empowering America's small businesses, which have been responsible for 80% of net new job growth in the U.S. since 1980. As President, Hillary will help lower costs and improve economic opportunities for small businesses, and help empower women and minority owned small businesses succeed:  Make sure that women- and minority-owned small businesses receive their fair share of government contracts. There are more than 2.5 million Hispanic-owned businesses in the U.S., contributing to the economic vitality and success of our country. Hillary will remove the obstacles that block too many of them from doing business with the federal government.   Raising and strengthening targets. Currently there is a target goal that 23% of government contracting dollars go to small businesses. Hillary will increase that goal to 30%. She would also raise the current 5% goals for disadvantaged and woman-owned small businesses to 8%. Finally, she will strengthen the guidelines for these targets to ensure that they are actually met. For example, under the Bush Administration, the SBA has crafted guidelines that will make it harder\u0412\u2014not easier\u0412\u2014for women-owned businesses to get their fair share of contracts. Hillary will appoint people to the SBA who actually understand that small businesses are vital to our economy, and who will write guidelines that tear down roadblocks, not put up new ones.  Ending bundling abuses. Small businesses applying for federal contracts often lose out to larger companies thanks to \"contract bundling\" \u2013 a practice where smaller contracts are \"bundled\" together into one large contract that only large businesses are able to transact. Hillary sees the proliferation of contract bundling as a threat to fair competition. Excessive bundling is not only bad for small businesses but wasteful of taxpayer dollars, because in many instances small businesses could be doing the work that is bundled together more efficiently than larger firms. As President, she will update criteria for when bundling is appropriate, require timely and accurate reporting of instances of bundling, and direct the SBA to conduct meaningful oversight to make sure that every agency complies with bundling regulations and hold senior administration officials accountable. She will also broaden the definition of bundling to cover new work. (The current definition applies only when two or more existing contracts are combined.)  Adjust net worth limits for the 8(a) program. Small business owners seeking to qualify for or remain in the 8(a) program\u0412\u2014which helps small and disadvantaged businesses compete for federal contracts\u0412\u2014must meet net-worth limits that have not been updated in nearly two decades. Hillary would adjust the new-owner net worth limit for inflation and abolish the net worth limit for business owners seeking to remain in the program.  Give new priorities to service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. In FY 2006, service-disabled veteran-owned businesses (SDV) received less than 1 percent of all federal procurement, far below the 3 percent statutory goal. To remedy this shortfall, Hillary will put SDVs on equal footing with 8(a) contractors in terms of eligibility for sole source contracts.  Double Funding for the Small Business Administration. As president, Hillary will double funding for the Small Business Administration, which has been cut by 50% under the Bush Administration. Budget cuts have degraded the SBA's ability to help entrepreneurs start and grow small businesses. For example, a GAO study found that business centers that help women-owned small businesses have laid-off staff and scaled back services because the SBA has been slow to deliver funding. [New York Times, 9/20/07]. Senator Clinton's funding increases will allow the SBA to provide loans, technical assistance and aide in winning government contracts to a wider range of small businesses.  Provide new small business tax cuts for healthcare: Hillary will also provide new tax credits to small businesses to make it easier for them to create new jobs with health care for their workers here in the U.S. Small businesses are the engine of new job growth in the U.S. economy but face bigger challenges when it comes to providing health care for their employees. Hillary's plan seeks to make it easier \u0412\u2014 not harder \u0412\u2014 for small businesses to create new jobs with health care for workers here in the U.S. Specifically, small businesses that provide quality coverage (e.g., benefits like what Members of Congress receive) and contribute most of the premiums for their workers would qualify for a refundable tax credit. The tax credit could be structured as a traditional policy (e.g., a credit equal to 50 percent of premiums for firms with fewer than 25 employees and less for medium-size employers). EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY  Hillary's education agenda starts with closing the early achievement gap; she will help address it by ensuring every child in America enters school ready to learn. As President, Hillary Clinton will: Universal pre-kindergarten. Hillary will provide access to high quality pre-kindergarten for all four-year-olds through a federal-state partnership. Her proposal pays particular attention to the need for these programs among children from limited-English and/or low income households - ensuring that they receive priority in enrollment and receive these services at no cost. Currently, only 40 percent of three-to-five-year-old Hispanics attend pre-k compared to about 60 percent of whites and blacks; in large part because pre-k isn't available or the price is out of reach in many Hispanic communities. One study of Tulsa, Oklahoma's pre-k-for-all program found benefits for all racial, ethnic, and socio-economic status groups but the gains for Hispanic students were especially impressive. Hispanic students experienced a 79 percent gain in letter-word identification (compared to 52 percent for whites), a 39 percent gain in spelling (compared to 26 percent for whites), and a 54 percent gain in applied problem solving (compared to 6 percent for whites).  Expand Head Start and Early Head Start. Hillary is proud to have helped create Early Head Start when she was First Lady and to have worked toward doubling it as a Senator. As President, She will continue to expand access to Head Start for the children of farm workers; end the underrepresentation of Latino children in Head Start and Early Head Start; ensure that assessments of children's growth and development are culturally and linguistically appropriate; and grow the programs overall to increase school readiness of Latino children.   Expand parent support programs. Hillary will also expand innovative nurse home visitation and parent education programs, such as Parents as Teachers and the Nurse Home Visitation Program, to help first-time mothers prepare for and care for their young children. One analysis of the Parents as Teachers program in Northern California found that this program improved children's cognitive, social, emotional skills even more so among children in Spanish-speaking Latino families than others.  But school readiness is just the beginning. We also need to do better by Hispanic children throughout the education pipeline so that they can realize their dreams and aspirations. That means raising achievement, closing the achievement gap, focusing on the drop out crisis and getting all Latino children to college. As President, Hillary Clinton will:  Cutting the Latino drop-out rate in half. The Latino dropout rate is far too high - half of all Latino kids don't graduate from high school on time. Hillary has supported the Graduation Promise Act, which makes a $2.5 billion investment to stop what have become known as \"high school drop out factories.\" Two thousand of these drop-out factories nation-wide produce the majority of our high school dropouts. The dropout rate for Hispanics is more than double the rate for African Americans and more than three times the rate for whites.   Expand GEAR UP to provide mentoring to Latino children. Many at-risk youth are falling off the track to higher education and career success early in the middle school years because they lack the tools and positive role models to get ahead. GEAR UP supports innovative partnerships between local school systems, colleges, businesses, and non-profit organizations to provide over a million middle-school students in high-risk schools with comprehensive college-readiness services including tutoring, mentoring, and college visits. Hillary will increase by 50 percent the number of children being served by GEAR UP.   Put college within reach for more Hispanic families. Only 12 percent of Hispanics eventually earn a bachelor's degree, compared with 33 percent of non-Hispanic whites. College enrollment and completion rates haven't increased over the past 20 years and more members of the freshman class at the University of Michigan have parents making at least $200,000 a year than have parents making less than the national median of $53,000. For Latinos, cost can be a major barrier; the total cost of public college tuition is one-third of the median household income compared with 24 percent for white students. Hillary will make a firm commitment to make college affordable when she is President. She will end the work penalty that discounts students' financial aid packages by as much as 50 percent for each dollar they earn; increase the Pell Grant maximum so that it keeps pace with the rising cost of college; and enact a student borrowers' bill of rights to ensure that loan payments are reasonable. And Hillary will work to increase funding for work-study and other federal financial aid and cut student loan interest rates.  Enact the DREAM Act. It will provide a path to citizenship for undocumented children by allowing them to go to college - at the same cost as other state residents for those attending state institutions - or serve in the military. The children of undocumented families often come to the United States at a very early age. They know no other home, and our current policy fails them by providing them no affordable path to college.  As President, Hillary Clinton will also focus on those young people who have traditionally been forgotten. As President, she will:  Help students stay in school and stay on track. Hillary will invest $100 million in a new public/private summer internship program to help one million at-risk middle-school students. Participation in internships teaches young people the value and potential of work and increase the likelihood that they will graduate from high school, go to college and find employment.  Support responsible fatherhood and provide second-chance jobs. Hillary will make sure that states and counties have adequate resources to collect child support and also make sure that these government agencies pass every dollar on to children; research has shown that fathers pay more of their child support and develop deeper bonds with their children if they know that those payments go directly to their children. She will also create new incentive-based re-entry partnership grants - investing $200 million over five years - that will create partnerships between correction facilities, community and religious organizations, community colleges or vocational programs, job placement agencies, and local employers so that all ex-offenders have the opportunity to rebuild their lives. At the end of 2005, there were almost three times as many Hispanic male inmates as whites per capita. Ex-offenders often end up committing crimes again in part because they face steep barriers to entering the legitimate labor market. COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM Hillary Clinton will bring the leadership that the country needs to finally pass a comprehensive immigration reform policy. Our current system is broken. It is at odds with our values as a nation and is simply not working. There are more than 12 million undocumented people currently living in the United States - that's nearly 1 in 20 workers. We have no ability to identify them or ensure that they are being treated fairly in the workplace. Hillary will enact comprehensive reform that is fair. She will also work to help change the negative tone and rhetoric that has divided our nation when it comes to immigration. This reform will:  Provide for a path to citizenship. We have to provide a path to legal status and earned citizenship to those who have been in this country and are working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar to become citizens.   Bolster border security. We must reduce the number of undocumented people coming to the United States. We need to deploy new technology that can help our border patrol agents be more effective in stopping the flow of undocumented immigrants into the country.   Maintain family reunification as a core principle. We must protect the sanctity of families and repair the broken, unfair bureaucratic system that forces lawful immigrants to live apart from their spouses and children.  Create an agricultural guest worker program. It will end the exploitation of undocumented agricultural workers and ensure that the wages of American workers are not undermined.   Expedite the process of entering the United States. We need to eliminate the backlog of immigration applications and make the wait time reasonable so that families aren't kept apart unnecessarily. We should capitalize on technological advances to streamline and standardize the system of applying to enter the United States. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY During the 1990s, the typical Latino household gained $6,400 in income, and the share of Latinos living in poverty declined from 30% in 1992 to 21.5% in 2000. Since President Bush took office the picture has been different. The typical Hispanic family has seen its real income fall nearly $1,000, and today there are more than nine million Hispanics living in poverty today. Hillary has a vision to restore shared prosperity for American families. As President, she will:  Lower taxes for middle class families: To help middle class families that are being battered by stagnant wages and skyrocketing costs, Hillary will provide new tax credits to help make healthcare and college affordable for families, and up to $1000 in matching tax cuts to help families save for their future.", "title": "Press Release - Hillary's Hispanic Agenda"}
