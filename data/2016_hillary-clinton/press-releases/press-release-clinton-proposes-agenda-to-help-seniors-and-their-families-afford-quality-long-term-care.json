{"date": "2007-12-08", "text": "Today in Winterset, Iowa, Hillary Clinton outlined her long-term care agenda to ensure that seniors and people with disabilities can get the high-quality care they need to live with security and dignity. Clinton's plan includes a $3,000 caregiving tax credit, a doubling of the elderly standard deduction and a long-term care insurance tax credit so that millions of seniors and their families can afford care. She would also end insurance discrimination and focus on the quality of care, tripling the funding for nursing home ombudsmen, creating a national system of background checks for long-term care workers and requiring disclosure of poor-performing nursing homes. \"Our seniors are caught between the soaring costs of care, the desire not to be a burden to their families, and the fear of hurting themselves or others because they are living without the care they need,\" Clinton said. \"It's time for a new beginning - and a new approach to helping Americans grow old with dignity. Our seniors deserve our love, our respect, and our care.\" The group most likely to need long-term care - those 85 and older - will grow from 5 million in 2006 to 21 million by 2050, creating a sandwich generation of Americans who are caring for their parents and their children. In Iowa, over 15 percent of the population is 65 or older, and the state ranks second among the states for population above 85. The average out-of-pocket costs facing family caregivers is $5,500 a year, more than most spend on their own health care and entertainment combined. To meet this challenge and support seniors and the army of unpaid caregivers that support them, Clinton's plan provides more choices, greater access, and higher quality.
