{"date": "2007-10-17", "text": "Campaign Unveils SC Impact of Hillary's New Work-Family Agenda, Gains Endorsement of SC Democratic Women's Past President (AIKEN) \u2013 The Hillary Clinton campaign today released a report detailing the South Carolina impact of Hillary's new work-family agenda while receiving the endorsement of former South Carolina Democratic Women's Council President Louisiana Wright. Wright, also former first vice president of the Aiken County Democratic Party and former Chair of the Aiken County First Steps Partnership Board, unveiled the benefits for South Carolina of Hillary's effort to give families the support they need to more effectively balance work and family obligations today at an announcement on the steps of the University of South Carolina Aiken campus's College of Business and Education Building. \"Working families in Aiken and across the state will benefit from Hillary's plan. Paid family leave would finally be real for 1.4 million more South Carolinians,\" Wright said. \"As past president of the State Democratic Women's Council, I'm supporting a woman who will change our country's direction and make sure that working families matter in the decisions of the White House.\" Hillary's work-family agenda will:   Expand paid leave across the country through a new State Family Leave Innovation Fund;  Extend the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to cover 13 million additional American workers and guarantee workers at least 7 paid sick days per year;  Promote model workplaces with grants to support new workplace flexibility programs and a federal telecommuting initiative;  Ensure better access to affordable, high quality child care; and  Prevent parents from being discriminated against because of pregnancy or their caregiving responsibilities.   According to today's impact report, up to 1.4 million private-sector workers in South Carolina could be impacted by Hillary's plan to extend access to family leave. In addition, Hillary is proposing to make a minimum of 7 sick days a year standard. That would mean help to nearly three-quarters of a million South Carolina workers who were without paid sick days in 2006. Forty-eight percent of private sector workers and 57 million total workers in the United States have no paid sick days at all. And 86 million workers do not have paid sick days that can be used to care for sick children. A complete copy of the impact report follows.
