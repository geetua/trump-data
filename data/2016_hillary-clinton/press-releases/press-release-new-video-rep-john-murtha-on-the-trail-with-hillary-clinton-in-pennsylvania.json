Watch the new video here Following is the script for the video: Let me tell you something. I've served with seven Presidents. I am convinced that we're in probably one of the worst situations that I've seen in the 35 years I've been in Congress. We need a person with experience, a person that understands the policy. When the Clinton administration left, there was a $250 billion surplus. Now, there's almost a $3 trillion deficit. The military has been so depleted by this war. We're spending $343 million dollars a day to build roads in Iraq and we're not spending money on the projects that are so important. ", "title": "Press Release - New Video: Rep.
