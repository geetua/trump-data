For the last nine months, the Hillary for Iowa team has been using the hashtag #ISpyIowa to document their travels across the Hawkeye State as they canvassed, phone banked, and organized to help Hillary Clinton win the Iowa caucus.There is nothing more beautiful than engaging with purpose, organizing with heart, and winning every single day. #ISpyIowa (gray's lake -- or gary's lake -- in beautiful des moines) pic.twitter.com/V6mbjzNzMP\u2014 Greta Carnes (@gretacarnes) May 12, 2015 Can't beat it. #ISpyIowa pic.twitter.com/fjpbx6PwNr\u2014 Adin Lenchner (@adinofacollege) May 14, 2015 Beautiful day in Boone county organizing for @HillaryforIA! #ISpyIowa pic.twitter.com/JbQTiiFBJx\u2014 Rob Bingham (@robbinghamIA) May 28, 2015 But when they were done taking in the view, Team Iowa got to work\u2014wherever they could find a spot.
