{"date": "2016-09-01", "text": "Hillary for America National Latino Vote Director Lorella Praeli released the following statement on Donald Trump's anti-immigrant hateful speech in Arizona:\"In his darkest speech yet, Donald Trump doubled down on his anti-immigrant rhetoric and attempted to divide communities by pitting people against each other and\u0412\u00a0demonizing\u0412\u00a0immigrants. Trump committed to\u0412\u00a0sending a new \"Deportation Task Force\" into American communities, rescinding the President's executive actions to protect DREAMers and their families, building a wall that he continues to claim will be paid for by Mexico, and made clear that \"Operation Wetback\" was not severe enough. The only immigrants allowed in the future are those that pass Donald Trump's own test of 'desirability.'\"Donald Trump once again showed us that he will continue his decades-long record of divisiveness and campaign of hate by pledging to forcibly remove every single undocumented immigrant from our country. He showed us, very clearly, what's at stake in this election by painting a picture of his idea of America: one in which immigrants are not welcomed and one in which innocent families are torn apart.\"", "title": "Hillary for America Statement on Trump's Anti-Immigrant Speech"}
