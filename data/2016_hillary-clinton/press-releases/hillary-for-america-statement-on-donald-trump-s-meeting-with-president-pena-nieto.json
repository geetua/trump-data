{"date": "2016-08-31", "text": "Today, Hillary for America Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri released the following statement:\"From the first days of his campaign, Donald Trump has painted Mexicans as\u0412\u00a0'rapists'\u0412\u00a0and criminals and has promised to deport 16 million people, including children and U.S. citizens. He has said we should force Mexico to pay for his giant border wall. He has said we should ban remittances to families in Mexico if Mexico doesn't pay up. What ultimately matters is what Donald Trump says to voters in Arizona, not Mexico, and whether he remains committed to the splitting up of families and deportation of millions.\"", "title": "Hillary for America Statement on Donald Trump's Meeting with President Pe\u0413\u00b1a Nieto"}
